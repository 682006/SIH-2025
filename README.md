🏅 AI-Powered Sports Talent Discovery Platform

📌 Overview
This project is an AI-driven mobile platform designed to identify hidden athletic talent across India. The application allows users to register, showcase their sports performance via video uploads, and get evaluated by AI models for skill, fitness, and fraud detection. The best-performing athletes are highlighted to the Sports Authority of India (SAI), while others are trained under Sports Authority of Odisha (SAO)—ensuring equal opportunities nationwide, especially for athletes from rural and underserved regions.

🎯 Objective
The primary goal is to build a fair, data-driven, and accessible sports talent scouting platform where:

Athletes can perform standard fitness tests (running, jumping, sit-ups, etc.) via their mobile devices.

AI analyzes videos to measure body posture, joint movement, and physical performance.

Fraudulent or manipulated videos are detected automatically.

Leaderboards classify players into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced categories.

Top athletes’ details are securely shared with SAI for national recognition.

✨ Uniqueness of Innovation
🔹 AI-Integrated Evaluation – The only app combining AI for analyzing athleticism.
🔹 Low Connectivity Support – Optimized for rural and low-internet regions.
🔹 Smart Fraud Detection – Instantly detects fake or manipulated videos.
🔹 Instant Results – Fast AI-driven evaluations and benchmark comparisons.
🔹 Classless Access – Open to anyone with a smartphone, ensuring inclusivity.

🌍 Potential Applications
🏫 Schools & Colleges – Early identification of student talent.
🏋️ Sports & Academic Centers – Personalized training programs.
🏟️ Sports Councils & Authorities – Large-scale, bias-free talent scouting.

📈 Market Potential
India has one of the largest youth populations with immense untapped sports talent, especially in rural areas. With initiatives like Khelo India and Fit India Movement, this platform:

Bridges the gap between rural talent and professional sports bodies.

Makes scouting fair, transparent, and skill-based rather than dependent on location or background.

Provides a scalable tool for government and private academies to discover future sports champions.
